# AR Maze Game
 We used augmented reality and real-world physics to create an immersive maze game. We produced a 3d maze using the unity game engine and vuforia, allowing us to use physics to guide a ball  through the maze and make the experience accessible in augmented reality, where the maze appears to be in the real world through the camera of a mobile device.
 The objective of the game is to find the exit of the maze while avoiding obstacles and traps along the way.
The purpose of the project is to create an engaging and interactive gaming experience that combines the fun of a 3D maze game with the excitement of AR technology. The project also serves as a way to explore the potential of AR technology in gaming and how it can be used to enhance the player's experience.
